"""Stop-hook gate: refuse to end the session while a milestone goal is unmet.

This is what `/cycle-goal` uses INSTEAD of Claude Code's built-in `/goal`, and
the substitution is an upgrade rather than a workaround:

  - `/goal` cannot be invoked by a skill. It is a built-in command, and the
    `SlashCommand` tool (where it exists at all) does not expose built-ins. The
    settings route is closed too: `type: "prompt"` hooks are only valid on
    PreToolUse / PostToolUse / PermissionRequest — never on Stop.
  - `/goal` judges the TRANSCRIPT with a small model. A confident sentence can
    satisfy it. This gate reads the FILESYSTEM: the acceptance record and the
    ROADMAP checkbox. An assertion cannot forge either.

Contract with `cycle-acceptance`: the run writes
`knowledge-base/acceptance/{milestone}-{date}.md` carrying `verdict: <TOKEN>` in
its frontmatter. Only ACCEPTED / ACCEPTED_WITH_CAVEATS satisfy the goal, and the
milestone's ROADMAP checkbox must read `[x]` — the same pair `cycle-roadmap`
requires before calling a milestone released.

Two safety properties, both deliberate:

  - **Fail-open.** Any unexpected error allows the stop. A gate that bricks the
    session is worse than a gate that misses once; the goal is to hold the
    process honest, not to trap the user.
  - **Bounded.** Each block increments a counter. Past `max_blocks` the gate
    releases with a warning, so an impossible goal cannot loop forever.

Reads the goal state from `.claude/cycle-goal.json`; absent state = no goal = allow.

Usage (wired automatically by install_goal_hook.py):
    python3 check_goal_met.py [--state PATH] [--project-root PATH]

Exit codes:
    0 — always. The decision travels in the JSON on stdout, per the Stop-hook contract.
