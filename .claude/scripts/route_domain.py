"""Route a repo (or a B-NNN item) to its domain specialist.

Deterministic, not heuristic. `/review`'s `detect_domain.py` guesses a technical domain
from keywords because it runs against an arbitrary plan. Here the item already declares
`repo:`, and a repo belongs to exactly one domain — so guessing would only add a way to
be wrong.

The routing table is PARSED from `rules/cycle-backlog.md § Domain routing` rather than
duplicated here. One table, one truth: a copy in code drifts from the rule the moment
someone edits one of them, and the drift is silent — work routes to a specialist who
cannot open the repo, and nothing errors.

Exit codes:
  0 — routed
  1 — repo not in the routing table (gate G1 refuses the item)
  2 — the routing table could not be read or parsed
  3 — routed to a specialist that does not exist on disk (a defect in the table itself)

Exit 3 used to be exit 0 printing `(none declared)`. The invariant behind it lived only in
`tests/test_route_domain.py`, and `install.sh` does not copy `tests/` — so in every consumer
repo the guard was absent and a domain pointing at a missing specialist answered `routed: true`
with `agent: null`. Measured while installing into TheoCode: a second three-column table inside
the `## Domain routing` section parses as routing, which invented two domains whose specialist
files were never written, and nothing objected. A resolution that names nobody is the same
vacuous gate D5 exists to catch — so the check belongs in the tool, which always runs, rather
than in a test suite that ships to nowhere.
